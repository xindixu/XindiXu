### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy designing and implementing full-stack features with complex functionalities at Pingboard. I'm passionate about improving user experience and understanding technologies on a deeper level. I usually work on the frontend aspect of web apps, using JavaScript, React, and Vue, but also intersted in other applications of CS.  In my spare time, I used to work on web apps as personal projects, but recently, I've been taking online courses such as Algorithms and Operating System. 

I'm looking for opportunites to participate in Open Source projects.
